Found issue in semantic and fuzzy areas. Like how scikit-learn and scikit learn are the same thing but are treated as different.
Like Flask and flask are treated as different.

Another issue is in the bachelor field. Most of the cv have bachlor in computer science, ai and related field. 
But if the cv were to come from agriculture backgorun the issue would be that it will give the full score to the cv despite 
coming from a different background.
